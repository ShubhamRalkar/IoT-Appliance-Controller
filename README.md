# IoT-Appliance-Controller
This project is done widely by many people around the world,
Many companies and tech giants are on it innovating.
So why do this project? The main reason is to learn about home
automation system using microcontrollers like ESP266,ESP32.
How to control our home using just a device. Our aim is to
convert any device such as LED, fan to process of charging our
devices into a smart system, An esp8266 based device, which can make various offline devices like fan, bulb online controllabe.
The device is controlled by using Blynk device. 
Speed/brightness can be controlled. 
Resources used:
1. Arduino
2. Blynk
3. EasyEda
4. Hardware Electronics
